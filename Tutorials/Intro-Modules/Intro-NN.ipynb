    "# Neural Network 101\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of a deep learning model depends on several factors. These include the choice of architecture, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the optimizer and activation functions used, and the number of training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While research literature and factors such as dataset type can help guide the selection of an appropriate model architecture, choosing other factors like the number of layers or training epochs typically requires a trial and error process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will get hands-on experience with this process. For simplicity, we will restrict the model architecture to a neural network (NN). However, you will have the opportunity to experiment with different activation functions, optimizers, network configurations, and training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, you will find simplified definitions of important terminology. We have intentionally kept the explanations non-technical, as theoretical exploration is beyond the scope of this project. However, if you are interested in learning more or gaining deeper insight, please refer to this link `https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/neural-networks-a-beginners-guide/` for further exploration.\n",

    "1) __NN__: A neural network (NN) is a deep learning model architecture inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of artificial neurons, which resemble biological brain cells. These neurons are organized into layers and are interconnected, mimicking the way brain cells are connected in the nervous system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) __Hidden Layer__: A neural network (NN) consists of three or more layers of neurons. The first and last layers are called the input and output layers, respectively. The layers between them are known as hidden layers (Layers with neurons highlighted in red).\n",
    "\n",
    "![NN model architecture](../../Images/NN.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) __Activation Function__: One of the key reasons for the widespread adoption of neural networks is their ability to capture non-linear patterns in data. This capability is made possible through the use of activation functions, which introduce non-linearity into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) __Optimizer__: Optimizer algorithms help a model improve its performance by reducing the error between its predicted and target values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) __Epochs__: An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset by the model during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) __Mean Squared Error__: The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. This metric penalizes larger errors more heavily, making it sensitive to outliers. A lower MSE indicates fewer large errors and smaller overall prediction errors."
